# Keyword-Extraction-Datasets

This repository contains seven annotated datasets for automatic keyword extraction task. Every dataset contains a document (.txt or .abstr) and its corresponding gold-standard keywords list (.key or .uncontr). These datasets were used for our study of supervised and unsupervised keyword extraction. Following are the links to our published works.

1. **sCAKE: Semantic Connectivity Aware Keyword Extraction**

Following are the datasets and the original papers which proposed them.

1. **Hulth2003**: Contains abstracts from *Inspec* dataset. Originally downloaded from https://github.com/snkim/AutomaticKeyphraseExtraction.
2. **WWW** and **KDD**: CS abstracts from KDD and WWW conferences. We have only kept those documents that contain at least two sentences and atleast one gold-standard keyword. Originally downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/s/3c57qar1b0xseob/kpshare.tgz?dl=0 (Link is not available now). Full dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/LIAAD/KeywordExtractor-Datasets/tree/master/datasets.
3. **Marujo2012**: News articles. Originally downloaded from https://github.com/snkim/AutomaticKeyphraseExtraction.
4. **Krapivin2012**: ACM full papers. Originally downloaded from https://github.com/snkim/AutomaticKeyphraseExtraction.
5. **Semeval2010**: ACM full papers. Originally downloaded from https://github.com/snkim/AutomaticKeyphraseExtraction.
6. **NLM500**: PubMed documents. Originally downloaded from https://github.com/zelandiya/keyword-extraction-datasets. *Created for abstractive KE task.*
